Below we provide an entity-relationship diagram. Setting up TCA’s Knowledge Base . Generate the .db file from the .sql file. 1. cd db/ 2. cat 1.0.4.sql | sqlite3 1.0.4.db`` . Download DBeaver Community tool from the link below . 1. https://dbeaver.io/ . Set the .db file path to DBeaver to view tables and data. To set right click on Database Navigator to choose create -&gt; connection -&gt; SQLite. Then set the path as follows by providing the absolute path of the .db file . Path: /&lt;path&gt;/1.0.4.db . Table Details . 1. entity_types . This contains all the entity types present in our taxonomy. Under each entity type we define entities. For example, the OS entity type contains the Linux|RedHat Linux as an entity. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO entity_types(entity_type_name) VALUES(?) . 2. entities . This contains all the named entities along with their types and mappings to Wikidata or DBPedia. The scores are obtained based on an entity linking algorithm. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO entities(entity_name, entity_type_id, external_link) VALUES(?,?,?) . For external link use the following format . {'name': '', 'qid': '&lt;QID&gt;', 'url': 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/&lt;QID&gt;', 'score': 1} . The QID can for a named enitity can be obtained from . https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page . 3. entity mentions . This contains mappings of raw mentions with their entities. Each entity could have multiple mentions. For example, Apache Tomcat can be called as Tomcat or Apache Tomcat. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO entity_mentions(entity_mention_name, entity_type_id, entity_id) VALUES(?,?,?) . 4. entity relations . This contains mappings of entities based on their compatibilities. For example, a relation might exists between Linux|* and Apache Tomcat which suggest Apache Tomcat is compatible with different variants of Linux such as RedHat Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS and so on. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO entity_relations(entity_parent_type_id, entity_parent_id, entity_child_type_id, entity_child_id, COTS) VALUES(?,?,?,?,?) . 5. docker base os images . This contains Docker specific base OS images. For example, RedHat Linux along with its mapping a DockerHub image. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO docker_baseos_images(container_name, OS, Docker_URL, Notes, CertOfImageAndPublisher, Certification_Status, OfficialImage, VerifiedPublisher, OpenShift_Correspondent_Image_URL, OpenShiftStatus) VALUES(?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) . 6. openshift base os images . This contains Openshift specific base OS images. For example, RedHat Linux along with its mapping a OpenShift image. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO openshift_baseos_images(container_name, OS, OpenShift_Correspondent_Image_URL, Notes, OpenShiftStatus, DockerImageType) VALUES(?,?,?,?,?,?) . 7. docker images . This contains Docker specific images. For example, Apache Tomcat long with its mapping a DockerHub image. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO docker_images(container_name, OS, lang, lib, app, app_server, plugin, runlib, runtime, Docker_URL, Notes, CertOfImageAndPublisher) VALUES(?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) . 8. openshift images . This contains OpenShift specific images. For example, Apache Tomcat long with its mapping a OpenShift image. A new entry can be added as .

This contains versions and licensing costs for all entities. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO entity_versions (id, entity_id, version, release_date, end_date, cost) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?) . 10. docker environment variable . This contains environment variables for all docker images. A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO docker_environment_variables(Environment_Variables, Container_Name, Required, Default_Values) VALUES(?,?,?,?) . 11. operator images . This contains operator specific images. For example, Postgresql along with its mapping a operator image . A new entry can be added as . INSERT INTO operator_images(container_name, OS, lang, lib, app, app_server, plugin, runlib, runtime, Operator_Correspondent_Image_URL, Operator_Repository, Other_Operators) VALUES(?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) .

    "content": "TCA takes client applications as a natural language description and recommends whether client applications can be containerized. For example, a client can provide the application description as the following. 1. App1: rhel, db2, java, tomcat . TCA takes the following steps to recommend the containerization. | Assessment: It assesses the application to standardize the inputs to relevant named entities present in our knowledge base. For details on the knowledge base please check the db folder. For example, the inputs in App1 get mapped as the following named entities. | . 1. App1: rhel: Linux|RedHat Linux, db2: DB2, java: Java, tomcat: Apache Tomcat . | Containerization: First, it recommends whether App1 can be containerized, partially containerized, or kept as it is. Then if App1 is recommended as containerized or partially containerized, TCA generates container images based on DockerHub or Openshift. For example, if a user decides to generate DockerHub related images, then TCA generates the following images. | . 1. tomcat|https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcats 2. db2|https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/db2 . For OpenShift, TCA generates the following images. 1. tomcat|https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/webserver31-tomcat8-openshift 2. db2|https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/cp.stg.icr.io/cp/ftm/base/ftm-db2-base .
